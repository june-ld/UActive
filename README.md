An app to view, manage, and check in to events going on around campus

This app will hopefully integrate with the event calendar at my university to give students a list of all activities going on any day.
They can see event details, start/end times, users currently there, users following the event, and the coordinator.
Students can check in to any event they participate in and earn points for doing so. Event coordinators can also create events on the app.

Currently working (if server is running):

1. Creating a user / login

2. Creating an event

3. Looking at events

4. Check in / obtaining a code

5. Creating / add to organization

6. Profile stats and levels

7. History

8. Offline mode (if user has already contacted the server at least once)

9. Java server to connect to (currently within the same network) In another project.

Currently looking into:

1. Creating a way to allow users to login easily without cheating. (one per person)

2. Integrating NFC to create a physical login checkpoint for coordinators

3. Allowing coordinators to obtain information about the users following them or checked in to their events.

4. A way to request events chronologically and a certain number at a time. (client)

5. Adding selfies to go with checkins

6. Editing profile, event details

7. Creating and editing organization profile

8. Viewing events by organization
